# Pro tiny

With such "amazing" features as:

ESD protection taken from the official A. micro

No fuse

Crenellated pins

No integrated voltage converter, only runs at 4,5-5,5v(down to 2,7 if you use it at 8mhz)

USB-C connector sunk into the board, and slighly portruding from the end for panel mounting

1,27mm pin spacing as i couldn't find any 1mm pin headers

Some extra pins broken out

Way too many vias

Way too many hours routing for my sanity, and i doubt it's optimal(i am a beginner)

Made to suit JLC manufacturing tolerances.
